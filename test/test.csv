"Two Dozen States’ Unemployment Funds in the Red, Nine More Within Six Months",2010-01-19 23:42:44-06:00,"The record 20 million Americans who collected unemployment insurance benefits last year landed on a safety net that was already deeply frayed. Now 25 states have borrowed more than $25 billion to keep benefits flowing after their trust funds ran dry, and the situation is deteriorating fast elsewhere.

A historical compromise has left responsibility for unemployment benefits largely in the hands of states, and they have fulfilled this charge with varying degrees of effectiveness.

In a series last summer with public radio’s Marketplace, we reported that only a handful of states had built up reserves sufficient to weather the Great Recession – and forecast a spate of borrowing by states where reserves ran out.

Half a year later, the direst predictions seem to be coming true: So far 25 states have borrowed more than $25 billion to keep benefits flowing after their trust funds ran dry. In many other states the situation is deteriorating fast.

Our new unemployment insurance tracker monitors states’ trust funds using the most up-to-date data available on the Web – and projects the health of funds six months into the future. To help readers understand the roots of each state’s fiscal fiasco or success it also pulls together other helpful information and historical data that can be downloaded. According to our projections, Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Kansas, Maryland, Massachussetts, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Vermont will find themselves in the red within six months.

And while states’ poor fiscal planning is a serious topic on its own, our tracker also follows the increasing human toll: so far businesses in 36 states face tax increases this year, ranging from a few dollars per worker to more than a thousand. Six states have moved to cut, freeze or otherwise restrict benefits, a number that is likely to increase. (See our breakdown of states’ projected increase in taxes—and cuts in benefits.)

Some states have focused the pain, like Virginia, where unemployed seniors who also receive Social Security face steep benefit cuts. Other states, like Pennsylvania, have taken a broader approach: all unemployment beneficiaries will receive 2.4 percent smaller checks starting this month.

Payroll Taxes Increase for Many Employers Across the U.S.,2010-01-19 23:33:24-06:00,"With the recession emptying unemployment insurance trust funds, many states are raising taxes on business owners, from a few dollars to nearly $1,000 per worker. And some states have started reducing or freezing the benefits that are paid out to the unemployed.

Last year was the worst Don Miller had seen in more than 20 years of running a graphic printing business in Norfolk, Va.

Business slumped 15 percent, and he had to lay off two of the three workers who helped him print stickers and signs for Navy ships.

Miller hopes to bring them back, but hiring will be more expensive for all Virginia business owners this year. The recession has emptied Virginia’s unemployment insurance trust fund, and the state is making up for it by raising taxes on employers and cutting benefits for seniors.

In 2009, the average business owner paid $95 per employee. This year, the tax will be $171, according to estimates by the state work force agency.

""It’s another added expense to hiring somebody,"" Miller says. ""Everything’s going up and business is going down.""

Similar tax increases are hitting employers nationwide this year as states struggle to pay the 5.5 million Americans currently collecting state jobless benefits. So far, high unemployment and, in many cases, poor planning have prompted 25 states to borrow more than $25 billion from the federal government to keep benefit checks in the mail.

In other states, unemployment compensation funds are still in the black, but reserves are rapidly dwindling. Nine more states likely will be borrowing by mid-year, according to a ProPublica analysis of state revenue and benefits.

Tax on businesses

Business owners in 36 states face tax increases ranging from a few dollars to nearly $1,000 per worker. Six states are scaling back or freezing benefits for the unemployed:

Jobless Pennsylvania workers will get 2.3 percent less in benefits starting this month, while the average tax this year for businesses will increase from $384 to $432 per worker.

Hawaii’s employers face an average increase from $90 to $1,070 per worker. The state also proposes decreasing the maximum benefit by as much as a third — about $190 per week.

Texas, where the trust fund is $1.4 billion in the red, has increased the average tax on employers from $89 to about $165 per worker.

Instead of fulfilling the unemployment insurance system’s purpose of stimulating the economy, these measures may contribute to joblessness, says Gary Burtless, an economist who studies labor policy at the Brookings Institution. ""We don’t want to pick this moment of all moments to boost taxes on employers,"" Burtless says. ""We want to encourage employers as much as possible to add to their payrolls.""

Workers are being hurt in another way — through benefit cuts. In Roanoke, Va., James Hay, 70, received a letter from the state informing him that his monthly benefits are being cut from about $800 to $100 because state law limits payments to Social Security recipients when the state’s fund runs low.

""I was devastated when I read it,"" Hay says. ""I thought, ‘Lord, what am I going to buy heating oil with this winter?’ ""

Like many other seniors, Hay was working full time to supplement his $1,400 monthly Social Security check, which he says was not enough to support him, his granddaughter and her two young children. Then the asphalt factory laid him off.

Unemployment insurance made up for some of the lost income, but now Hay is not sure how his family will get by. ""We’ll just have to do whatever we can do,"" he says. ""I hope and pray we’ll be all right.""

States borrow heavily

The state hopes to save about $11 million through the cuts to seniors but anticipates borrowing about $1.3 billion to replenish its unemployment fund before the recession ends.

""The middle of a recession is when people need help most,"" says Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers. Cutting unemployment benefits, he says, ""undermines the fundamental goals of the program — boosting the economy and keeping people out of poverty in an economic downturn.""

Many states such as Virginia are already at or near the highest payroll tax rates allowed by law, and others have pushed politically difficult tax increases through their legislatures, making further benefit cuts likely if high unemployment persists, says Rich Hobbie, executive director of the National Association of State Workforce Agencies.

Some of the pain might have been avoidable. Long before the recession began, Virginia and many other states that have imposed tax increases or benefit cuts let their trust funds dwindle well below the 18 months of reserves the Labor Department recommends.

Virginia had to slow its need to borrow from the federal government despite the impact on businesses and seniors, says Republican state Sen. John Watkins, chairman of the Virginia Commission for the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. ""I have angst for people who are unemployed,"" he says. ""But our trust fund is busted — it’s gone.""

How We Did the Math on Our Unemployment Insurance Tracker,2010-01-19 21:59:33-06:00,"We’ve just launched our Unemployment Tracker, an application that follows the current balance of each state’s unemployment trust fund and predicts future solvency. As of January 2010, 25 states have run out of funds and been forced to borrow from federal government, raise taxes or cut benefits. We project another nine heading into the red within six months.

For each state, we gathered the freshest information on unemployment programs, including how much the state paid out in benefits and how much it earned in unemployment tax revenue. Then we plugged the numbers into a formula we created that projects the trust fund’s trend out for six months, and another formula that gauges the fund’s current health.

Here’s what our data includes for each state:

Unemployment trust fund balances from Treasury

Benefits paid out by the Department of Labor

Revenues collected from unemployment taxes on employers

Interest earned by state trust funds

Funds distributed to states for unemployment system administration

Where does this data come from?

The Department of Labor releases unemployment revenues and benefits for each state quarterly, but often that data is two quarters old. Instead of relying on stale data, we found up-to-date information on the Web sites of the Department of Treasury and the Department of Labor.

Neither site offers a standard downloadable format for the data, so we pulled the data from searchable databases for each of the three monthly values we needed:

Benefits are at the Monthly Program and Financial Data tool at Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration Web site. For benefits reporting we included the values logged in the Benefits Paid column in these reports.

For benefits reporting we included the values logged in the Benefits Paid column in these reports. Revenues are at the Treasury Department’s “Unemployment Trust Fund Report” page under Transaction Statement (sample report) Each state collects revenue from two main sources, tax income and balance transfers from other states. When an eligible person moves out of state, his home state pays the new state his remaining balance from the fund. For our purposes, a given month’s revenue is the sum of each these two. We’ve also included other amounts of income such as interest payments or administrative disbursements even though they are relatively small.

We’ve also included other amounts of income such as interest payments or administrative disbursements even though they are relatively small. Trust Fund Balances - The Treasury Department also tracks each trust fund balance and presents from the same interface report under “Account Statement.” These present a summary of all transactions—revenue and benefit payments—for the month. They also provide the month’s ending balance on the very last line which is the number we’re looking for.

You can download this data for each state from the state pages on the Unemployment Tracker.

What does this data tell us:

Trust fund balance - This is simply a monthly snapshot of the amount of money in each state’s trust fund. Trust fund balances tick up and down as revenues come in and benefits payments go out. Once a state is borrowing, the trust fund balance becomes a much more static amount. Many borrowing states allow their balance to approach zero; others will maintain a small balance while the bulk of benefits payments are actually financed by federal loans.

Many borrowing states allow their balance to approach zero; others will maintain a small balance while the bulk of benefits payments are actually financed by federal loans. Revenues - This represents the money coming into the state’s trust fund from taxes collected, stimulus payments, interest earned and administration funds. Plotting this data tells us several important things about a state fund’s health. First, in nearly all states a significant drop in revenue since the start of the recession can be observed. Second, the peaks in a state’s revenue curve give an indication of its tax policies. States that tax only the first few thousand dollars of each worker’s income (the federal minimum is $7,000) will see nearly all of their revenue by the second quarter of the year. This is particularly relevant now, because those states can anticipate very limited revenue for the next five months, while their benefits obligations remain high.

Benefits - With the recession, every state has seen an uptick in the amount of benefits paid out. In states where the increase in unemployment has been modest, the benefits paid out have increased only slightly. In other states, a many-fold increase in unemployment has led to a dramatic spike in benefits paid out. Where benefits exceed revenues, shown in the graph by a benefit curve that is higher than the revenue curve, the trust fund balance will decrease. Many states show a precipitous decline in trust fund balance in recent months.

Where benefits exceed revenues, shown in the graph by a benefit curve that is higher than the revenue curve, the trust fund balance will decrease. Many states show a precipitous decline in trust fund balance in recent months. Net income - This is just a measure of the number of dollars a state’s trust fund changed last month. For November, all states had a negative net income, sometimes very significant. On average, states that were not already borrowing saw their trust funds lose 13 percent of their value. In some states the decrease was as high as 50 percent.

To add context to the graphs, we are also including the state’s most recent unemployment rate, level of benefits and the percent of unemployed workers receiving benefits. For further context, these values are also ranked relative to other states. Taken together, these indicators paint a picture of state policies. In particular, some states have maintained solvency by paying low benefits or tightly restricting worker eligibility for benefits.

Predicting the future

We used our database of monthly revenues, benefits and trust fund balances to analyze each trust fund’s future potential.

Each state’s unemployment trust fund is an account that is bolstered by tax revenue and depleted by unemployment benefits. In any given month, the trust fund balance will be the balance of the month before plus that month’s net income (revenues minus benefits), or as a formula:

Where m is the current month. In order to project trust fund balances, we can use the current trust fund balance and sum the differences of projections for both revenues and benefits:

where n is the number of months in the future we’re trying to predict and BEN avg is a simple average of the benefits collected in the most recent quarter:

To calculate REV adj we summed the revenue of the most recent quarter and divided that by the sum of the revenue of the corresponding quarter last year. This gave us a correction factor that allowed us to adjust last year’s revenue for the month we’re trying to predict. Then we multiplied that factor by the corresponding month we tried to predict from last year:

Predicting benefits proved relatively easy: they tend to slowly migrate up and down, making a rolling average a fairly accurate predictor. Predicting revenues was the hard part - they fluctuate wildly from month to month. However, using data from last year, adjusted for the revenue drop-off that most states saw in 2009, allowed us to predict revenues with a reasonable degree of accuracy. This chart comparing California’s 2008 revenues to our predictions, for example, shows our estimated curve has the right shape and similar values:

Please note that when a state starts borrowing from the federal government we can’t project a future trust fund balance because some or all revenue is set aside to pay down the outstanding loan.

Gauging the Past

The Unemployment Tracker also flags the periods a state’s fund is in trouble. Because we can rely on real data from the past the formula is simpler than our projection formula:

This formula essentially flags any state where benefits paid out exceed revenues to a point that cannot be sustained by the trust fund for more than four months.

Our Articles on Wounded Iraq and Afghan Interpreters—Now in Arabic,2010-01-19 16:30:16-06:00,"Al Hayat, a pan-Arabic newspaper based in London, has translated and published a ProPublica story about the health care struggles faced by Iraqi and Afghan citizens wounded while working as interpreters for U.S. soldiers. Part of a continuing series on injured civilian contractors, the original story detailed how injured local interpreters suffered shoddy treatment in a system funded by American taxpayers to provide medical care and disability benefits. Many of the interpreters fled to the U.S. after becoming targets for the insurgency. Once here, they found themselves isolated and in poverty, fighting with private insurance companies who often denied claims for medical treatment. More than 360 Iraqi and Afghan interpreters died while working as translators for defense firms contracted with the military—a larger death toll than any other nation’s armed forces except for the United States.

To supplement Al Hayat’s coverage, ProPublica is translating and posting two related stories. The first piece concerns a doctor who treated hundreds of Iraqi interpreters while working for troubled insurance giant AIG in Jordan. Patients later complained that the doctor did not provide the appropriate treatment—a claim denied by the doctor. The English version is here. A second story takes a look at Iraqi support workers, who have sometimes settled their medical claims for a fraction of the total due to them by insurance providers. Here’s the original."

"More Lobbying, Less Registration: Influence-Peddling Goes Underground",2010-01-19 10:17:02-06:00,"This is one of our editors' picks from our ongoing roundup of Investigations Elsewhere .

On Sunday, The New York Times reported that even as influence-peddling in Washington is booming, practitioners are increasingly shying away from registering as lobbyists, moving their work out of public view.

According to the Times, ethics reforms passed by Congress in 2007 account for some of the changes in lobbyist behavior. While the legislation tightened reporting requirements and upped penalties, it also ""left the definition of a lobbyist fairly elastic.""

The new lobbying restrictions imposed by the Obama administration are also having an effect. While some lobbyists have criticized the rules as being too tough, open-government groups have pointed out that the administration has granted waivers for more than a dozen former lobbyists to get top jobs in the government. In an attempt to get around a more recent set of administration rules, some corporate lobbyists told the Times they were ""revising job descriptions in light of the administration’s decision to bar registered lobbyists from sitting on industry advisory panels.""

The article comes on the heels of a November 2009 study from the nonpartisan groups OMB Watch and the Center for Responsive Politics that found a spike in the number of lobbyists who were ""deregistering"" in recent years while noting that ""thousands of lobbyists who appear to have left their line of work may not have actually done so.""

"Logjam Continues for Loan Mods; Big Banks Fare Poorly, Data Show",2010-01-19 07:59:03-06:00,"First, a look at the overall numbers: 66,465 homeowners had received permanent modifications as of Dec. 31. That’s up from 31,382 reported last month . On a conference call with reporters Friday, Treasury official Phyllis Caldwell called that a “significant acceleration of the rate at which borrowers are being approved.” That may be, but it’s still well below where it should be if the program were working properly.

The Treasury unveiled (PDF) new data last Friday showing the progress of its major foreclosure prevention program. Treasury officials touted the new data as evidence that pressure on mortgage servicers to improve performance was working, but the numbers continue to show real problems. And though there is a wide disparity in performance among the participating servicers, the four largest all continue to lag.

Under the program, homeowners are first given three-month trial loan mods. About 900,000 homeowners have begun such trials, which are supposed to give borrowers enough time to turn in all their documentation and demonstrate an ability to make the lower monthly payments. But as we’ve reported, trials have been stretching much longer. The servicers have largely blamed homeowners for this, saying that they’ve been slow in turning their documents in. Homeowners, meanwhile, routinely complain that servicers lose documents and make mistakes.

In response to all those problems, the Treasury has allowed servicers to lengthen some trial periods to as long as five months. But trials have stretched still longer. As we’ve reported, services have kept some homeowners in “trial” purgatory for as many as nine months.

The numbers reflect that logjam. In October, the Treasury reported (PDF) that servicers had begun a total of 487,081 trial modifications. But three months later, less than 24 percent of those loans have had any sort of final resolution. In other words, 76 percent of the trial mods started three or more months ago are still in limbo.

As our chart shows, just 66,465 trials have been converted into permanent modifications, and 48,924 trials have failed – a total of 115,389. The Treasury officials made a point Friday of saying that some homeowners, about 46,000, have been approved for a permanent modification, but haven’t yet signed the paperwork to make it final. Even including that number, only one-third of the homeowners who began trials three or more months ago have had final answers.

Our chart also shows the wide divergence in performance among servicers. To show how the borrowers in trials are faring at each servicer, we’ve shown each servicer’s number of permanent modifications and failed trials as a portion of the trial modifications they had begun as of three months ago. Overall, only about 14 percent of the trials begun three or more months ago have been made permanent. Ten percent have failed.

The big names are among the worst-performing servicers. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, CitiMortgage and Wells Fargo together account for more than 60 percent of the 3.4 million mortgages eligible for the program. All four have converted a small percentage of the trials begun three or more months ago into permanent modifications. The highest is Wells Fargo, with only 13 percent.

The worst among them is by far the largest: Bank of America. The data show the bank is moving a relatively low number of homeowners into trials (206,775 homeowners have received trials, while over 1 million are eligible, according to Treasury) and then converting very few of those to permanent modifications. Of the trials begun by Sept. 30, it has only converted 3,305, or about 3 percent, to permanent modifications. In a press release Friday, Bank of America said that it had offered permanent modifications to many more (about 12,000). If so, those numbers will be reflected in the numbers released next month.

There doesn’t seem to be a good example of a model servicer in the program. The closest would seem to be GMAC Mortgage. The numbers show that it has moved about half of its eligible loans into trials, and then converted about half of those into permanent modifications. No other servicer has performed quite so well in both categories.

Some servicers have moved very few homeowners into the trial stage, but have converted a high percentage of them into permanent modifications. Carrington Mortgage Services, for instance, had begun 584 trial modifications as of the end of September. That’s a very small portion of its eligible loans, suggesting a high barrier of entry to the program. But Friday’s report shows that 608 homeowners have received permanent modifications, meaning the company is, on average, offering trial participants a permanent modification in under three months.

One other servicer, Ocwen, a company that specializes in troubled loans, has performed similarly. Its executive vice president Paul Koches told ProPublica that Ocwen’s high conversion rate is a result of requiring documents from homeowners before they enter the trial stage – as opposed to some other servicers that have accepted homeowners based on what they say their income is. The Treasury program allows for both approaches. Koches disputed the idea that Ocwen was putting few (20 percent) of its eligible homeowners into trials, as the data produced by Treasury suggests; the numbers do not reflect Ocwen customers who are on in-house modifications, he said, and reflect a large volume of loans that it began servicing only at the very end of the year.

Some companies, meanwhile, have a remarkably high failure rate on trials. Two servicers, Litton Loan Servicing and Aurora Loan Services, have denied more than twice as many homeowners in trials as they have approved for permanent modifications. We’ve asked both companies for explanations, but trials can fail for a number of reasons: a homeowner might not make the trial payments (Treasury official Michael Barr said Friday that overall, 25 percent of homeowners in trials were defaulting), the homeowner might never have turned in the necessary documents, or the homeowner might not meet the program’s requirements.

Asked Friday about the disparities among servicers, Barr said that some are “just doing a better job.”

Have you applied for a loan modification under the Obama administration’s Making Home Affordable program? Are you thinking about it? If so, we at ProPublica want to hear your story.
