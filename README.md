Regarding the Chicago Tribune:

They launched a beta of their archives (within the last week/week and a half), which also made available an articles.chicagotribune page from which we realized we were able to scrape 3 days before our assignment was due (prior to this their archives were not scrapeable, they were going through propquest which blocked scarping).  We scraped 8 months of data, but stopped to concentrate on completeing other aspects of the assignment.

The database has 5 years of article information from La Jornada and ProPublica.
